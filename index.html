     <ul> 
       <ol><h3>what was my inspiration.</h3>
       <p> My inspiration behind creating this website is giving kids the freedom to go and find interesting news storys without parents worrying what nasty or horrifying things are there as well. </p></ol>
       <ol> <h3>why did i want to do this.</h3>
       <p> I want to do this website bescause i remember growing up and loveing to watch the news,but i couldn't because my mom was worried what i would see along the way to finding the news story appropriate for me. I asked my mom if a website like mine was developed when i was a kid, woukd she have less to worry about? she said definetly. she probably would benefit from it as well.</p></ol>
       <ol> What will ths site do?
       <p> what this site will do is make it easier for kids to find age appropriate news for them. This will also help parents with the struggle of wondering wether or not their kid is safe looking at news on their phone,ipad or computer by themselve's. </ol>
